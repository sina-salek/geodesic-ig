% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered

\begin{abstract}
Integrated Gradients (IG), a widely used path-based attribution method, assigns importance scores to input features by integrating gradients of the models along a straight path from a baseline to the input. While effective in certain cases, we show that choosing straight paths can lead to flawed attributions. In this paper, we identify how these misattributions arise. As a solution, we propose a new approach that considers the input space as a Riemannian manifold and computes attributions by integrating gradients of the model along geodesics. We call our approach \emph{Geodesic Integrated Gradients}. To approximate geodesic paths, we introduce two methods: a \emph{k}-nearest neighbour-based approach for simpler models and a Stochastic Variational Inference-based method for more complex ones. Furthermore, in our experiments with both synthetic and real world data, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing explainability methods including the original IG.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022. 
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
